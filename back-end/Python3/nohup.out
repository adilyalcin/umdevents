title: Reflections on Human Dignity
description: In this working conference, we will bring together human rights theorists, philosophers, psychologists and political and social scientists in an effort to explore the concept of human dignity from a variety of perspectives. Our overall purpose is to examine the meaning of the concept of human dignity; to examine how human dignity may be linked to the unique ontological status of human beings; how efforts to promote and protect human dignity serve to advance the interests of humanity as a species; and how human moral and spiritual aspirations animate concern for human dignity at the level of personal relationships, relationships among and between ethnic and cultural groups and among and between nations. Eight distinguished speakers include UMD's three Peace Chairs, Jack Donnelly, Michael Penn, Barbara Finkelstein, Michael Karlberg, Sania Anwar.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents "Waking the Green Tiger"
description: Waking the Green Tiger tells the dramatic story of the rise of the first major grassroots environmental movement in China! Seen through the eyes of farmers, journalists, activists and a former government insider, the film presents the extraordinary campaign to stop a huge dam project on the Upper Yangtze River in southern China. It portrays the history of Chairman Mao's campaigns to conquer nature in the name of progress. Mao mobilized millions of people in campaigns that reshaped China's landscape, destroyed lakes, forests and grasslands, and unleashed dust storms. The green movement emerged when a new environmental impact law was passed in 2004. For the first time in China, ordinary citizens gained the right to speak out and take part in government decisions. Green activism grew into a larger movement as villagers and activists joined forces to oppose a massive new dam at Tiger Leaping Gorge on the Upper Yangtze that would have displaced 100,000 people.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents "Waking the Green Tiger"
description: Waking the Green Tiger tells the dramatic story of the rise of the first major grassroots environmental movement in China! Seen through the eyes of farmers, journalists, activists and a former government insider, the film presents the extraordinary campaign to stop a huge dam project on the Upper Yangtze River in southern China. It portrays the history of Chairman Mao's campaigns to conquer nature in the name of progress. Mao mobilized millions of people in campaigns that reshaped China's landscape, destroyed lakes, forests and grasslands, and unleashed dust storms. The green movement emerged when a new environmental impact law was passed in 2004. For the first time in China, ordinary citizens gained the right to speak out and take part in government decisions. Green activism grew into a larger movement as villagers and activists joined forces to oppose a massive new dam at Tiger Leaping Gorge on the Upper Yangtze that would have displaced 100,000 people.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents "Waking the Green Tiger"
description: Waking the Green Tiger tells the dramatic story of the rise of the first major grassroots environmental movement in China! Seen through the eyes of farmers, journalists, activists and a former government insider, the film presents the extraordinary campaign to stop a huge dam project on the Upper Yangtze River in southern China. It portrays the history of Chairman Mao's campaigns to conquer nature in the name of progress. Mao mobilized millions of people in campaigns that reshaped China's landscape, destroyed lakes, forests and grasslands, and unleashed dust storms. The green movement emerged when a new environmental impact law was passed in 2004. For the first time in China, ordinary citizens gained the right to speak out and take part in government decisions. Green activism grew into a larger movement as villagers and activists joined forces to oppose a massive new dam at Tiger Leaping Gorge on the Upper Yangtze that would have displaced 100,000 people.

Everywhere we turn these days, we find that networks can be used to describe relevant interactions. In this talk, Dr. Chayes looks quite generally at some of the models we are using to describe these networks, processes we are studying on the networks, algorithms we have devised for the networks, and finally, methods we are developing to indirectly infer network structure from measured data. In particular, she will discuss models and techniques which cut across many disciplinary boundaries.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

title: "Dante in the World of Demons and Demonologists"
description: THE DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH AND ITALIAN cordially invites you to a lecture by PROFESSOR WALTER STEPHENS, Johns Hopkins University "Dante in the World of Demons and Demonologists" Dante's Inferno gathers a number of strands of medieval thinking aboutthe underworld and the role of demons in it, and in the world of the living. Dante's sources range from popular spectacle to serious theology, including the early formation of the Roman Inquisition. As meticulous on this subject as he is on all others, Dante exemplifies the importance of the "invisible world" which he makes visible for medieval culture.

title: Farmers Market TODAY!
description: Earth day was on Monday, but why not continue the celebration at The Farmers Market at Maryland TODAY? Purchasing locally grown food is a great way to get fresh, seasonal, tasty and healthy ingredients. And because the distance from farm to market is usually small, a lot less fuel is needed to transport the produce directly to you - which is good for the planet. Be even greener by bringing your own re-usable shopping bag! Your visit to the market today will also give you a chance to meet the folks from Sigma Alpha - a professional agricultural sorority, SGA, and the UMD Arboretum -- stop by their tables to learn more about their programs and initiatives. The Farmers Market at Maryland is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare.

Everywhere we turn these days, we find that networks can be used to describe relevant interactions. In this talk, Dr. Chayes looks quite generally at some of the models we are using to describe these networks, processes we are studying on the networks, algorithms we have devised for the networks, and finally, methods we are developing to indirectly infer network structure from measured data. In particular, she will discuss models and techniques which cut across many disciplinary boundaries.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

title: SEE Presents: An Evening with Tony Mendez
description: The 2012 Academy Award for Best Picture-winning film, "Argo," comes to life during An Evening with Tony Mendez. Tony Mendez is the retired CIA officer on whom the film's lead role was based, portrayed by Ben Affleck. In January 1980, Mendez was awarded the Intelligence Star for Valor for engineering and conducting the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Iran during the hostage crisis. This rescue operation involved creating a Hollywood film production company, complete with scripts, publicity and real estate in LA. Warner Brothers made the feature film based on the rescue of the hostages out of the Canadian embassy in Tehran. Mendez's book, "ARGO: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled off the Most Audacious Rescue in History," was published prior to the film's release. The first portion of the lecture will include a moderated discussion led by Mendez's wife, Jonna, followed by an opportunity for students to ask their own questions.

title: "Dante in the World of Demons and Demonologists"
description: THE DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH AND ITALIAN cordially invites you to a lecture by PROFESSOR WALTER STEPHENS, Johns Hopkins University "Dante in the World of Demons and Demonologists" Dante's Inferno gathers a number of strands of medieval thinking aboutthe underworld and the role of demons in it, and in the world of the living. Dante's sources range from popular spectacle to serious theology, including the early formation of the Roman Inquisition. As meticulous on this subject as he is on all others, Dante exemplifies the importance of the "invisible world" which he makes visible for medieval culture.

description: Vivian Hoffmann, Assistant Professor, Department of Agriculture & Resource Economic, University of Maryland About the Talk: Public subsidy of preventative health technologies is often justified based on the positive externalities generated by interrupting disease transmission. In the case of technologies that require active use to be effective, fully subsidizing inputs may not be sufficient to generate the desired externality. On the other hand, charging non-zero prices may screen out many of those who would use a product.

Everywhere we turn these days, we find that networks can be used to describe relevant interactions. In this talk, Dr. Chayes looks quite generally at some of the models we are using to describe these networks, processes we are studying on the networks, algorithms we have devised for the networks, and finally, methods we are developing to indirectly infer network structure from measured data. In particular, she will discuss models and techniques which cut across many disciplinary boundaries.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed?

description: Co-Sponsors: CRGE, AASD Speaker: Dr. Adia Harvey-Wingfield, Associate Professor, Sociology - Georgia State University Date: Friday, April 26th at 12:00 p.m. Room 1101 Art/Sociology Building "No More Invisible Man" (Temple University Press) provides a rare intersectional analysis of the ways that gender, race, and class collectively impact black professional men's work in white male-dominated occupations.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents an Evening with Susie Erenrich on "Rhythms of Rebellion: Artists Creating Dangerously for Social Change!"
description: On December 14, 1957, after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Albert Camus challenged artists attending a lecture at the University of Uppsala in Sweden to create dangerously. Even though Camus never defined what he meant by his charge, throughout history, artists involved in movements of protest, resistance, and liberation have answered Camus' call. Often, the consequences were costly, resulting in imprisonment, censorship, torture, and death. This seminar examines the question of what it means to create dangerously by taking up Camus' challenge to artists. It looks at two artists, Augusto Boal and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who were detained, tortured, and imprisoned because they boldly defied the dominant power structure. It also focuses on a group of artists, the Mississippi Caravan of Music, involved in the struggle for civil rights in the United States. These artists from around the globe were involved in acts of rebellion, resistance, revolt, or revolution that made history.

description: Vivian Hoffmann, Assistant Professor, Department of Agriculture & Resource Economic, University of Maryland About the Talk: Public subsidy of preventative health technologies is often justified based on the positive externalities generated by interrupting disease transmission. In the case of technologies that require active use to be effective, fully subsidizing inputs may not be sufficient to generate the desired externality. On the other hand, charging non-zero prices may screen out many of those who would use a product.

In this talk, Dr. Chayes looks quite generally at some of the models we are using to describe these networks, processes we are studying on the networks, algorithms we have devised for the networks, and finally, methods we are developing to indirectly infer network structure from measured data. In particular, she will discuss models and techniques which cut across many disciplinary boundaries.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents an Evening with Susie Erenrich on "Rhythms of Rebellion: Artists Creating Dangerously for Social Change!"
description: On December 14, 1957, after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Albert Camus challenged artists attending a lecture at the University of Uppsala in Sweden to create dangerously. Even though Camus never defined what he meant by his charge, throughout history, artists involved in movements of protest, resistance, and liberation have answered Camus' call. Often, the consequences were costly, resulting in imprisonment, censorship, torture, and death. This seminar examines the question of what it means to create dangerously by taking up Camus' challenge to artists. It looks at two artists, Augusto Boal and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who were detained, tortured, and imprisoned because they boldly defied the dominant power structure. It also focuses on a group of artists, the Mississippi Caravan of Music, involved in the struggle for civil rights in the United States. These artists from around the globe were involved in acts of rebellion, resistance, revolt, or revolution that made history.

title: MPRC Seminar: Micro-Ordeals & Preventative Health Products: Evidence on Short-Term Take-Up and Habit Formation
description: Vivian Hoffmann, Assistant Professor, Department of Agriculture & Resource Economic, University of Maryland About the Talk: Public subsidy of preventative health technologies is often justified based on the positive externalities generated by interrupting disease transmission. In the case of technologies that require active use to be effective, fully subsidizing inputs may not be sufficient to generate the desired externality. On the other hand, charging non-zero prices may screen out many of those who would use a product.

description: Dr. Jennifer Chayes, distinguished scientist and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England, will speak on "Age of Networks." Everywhere we turn these days, we find that networks can be used to describe relevant interactions. In this talk, Dr. Chayes looks quite generally at some of the models we are using to describe these networks, processes we are studying on the networks, algorithms we have devised for the networks, and finally, methods we are developing to indirectly infer network structure from measured data. In particular, she will discuss models and techniques which cut across many disciplinary boundaries.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

description: TEMPO is a contemporary music ensemble run entirely by graduate students of the University of Maryland School of Music. Concerts specialize in performance of music written post-1950. TEMPO had its second call for musical scores this spring and received over 100 pieces from students across the world! Works to be performed include the winning piece chosen from our call by Canadian student composer, Lucas Oickle, Earl Kim, Mikolaj Gorecki, Toru Takemitsu, and Joseph Schwantner. The purpose of the concert will be to introduce the music of important contemporary composers to the university community and encourage interdisciplinary dialogue. TEMPO has produced a concert every semester since the fall of 2008. Admission is free and attendance fulfills a concert-reporting requirement for students taking music courses. We foresee attendance by a mixture of faculty, staff, graduate students, undergraduates, and community members. A reception will follow the performance.

title: Beyond the Classroom presents an Evening with Susie Erenrich on "Rhythms of Rebellion: Artists Creating Dangerously for Social Change!"
description: On December 14, 1957, after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Albert Camus challenged artists attending a lecture at the University of Uppsala in Sweden to create dangerously. Even though Camus never defined what he meant by his charge, throughout history, artists involved in movements of protest, resistance, and liberation have answered Camus' call. Often, the consequences were costly, resulting in imprisonment, censorship, torture, and death. This seminar examines the question of what it means to create dangerously by taking up Camus' challenge to artists. It looks at two artists, Augusto Boal and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who were detained, tortured, and imprisoned because they boldly defied the dominant power structure. It also focuses on a group of artists, the Mississippi Caravan of Music, involved in the struggle for civil rights in the United States. These artists from around the globe were involved in acts of rebellion, resistance, revolt, or revolution that made history.

In the case of technologies that require active use to be effective, fully subsidizing inputs may not be sufficient to generate the desired externality. On the other hand, charging non-zero prices may screen out many of those who would use a product.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

The focus is on subtle aromatherapy and scent, and how they affect the emotions using the stress as an example. Unlike our other senses that are perceived by the left brain/frontal cortex, aromas and our sense of smell is perceived by our right brain/limbic brain, which is the seat of our emotions, memories and the regulation of key bodily functions like sleep, hunger, thirst, body temperature and sex drive. It is also the source of our "fight or flight" danger and stress response. All are welcome at this free public event. Light refreshments will be provided after the workshop.

title: PHYSICS COLLOQUIUM: Ultrafast AMO Physics with strong laser fields: High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Free Electron Lasers
description: The natural time scale for internal motion in atoms and small molecules is dictated by their Angstrom sizes and Rydberg binding energies to be femtoseconds or shorter. The binding fields for the outermost electrons are tens of volts per Angstrom. Phil Bucksbaum, Stanford University, will describe recent experiments designed to measure the interaction of atoms and molecules with laser fields on these scales of time and field strength. Two kinds of laser sources are employed: Strong focused infrared lasers create these extreme conditions within a single optical cycle, and thereby induce atomic phenomena that evolve during fractions of a femtosecond. This is the regime of high harmonic generation. X-ray free electron lasers can also produce these extreme fields, but at much higher oscillation frequencies. This is the regime of rapid inner shell ionization and Auger relaxation.

This talk offers a philosophy of crowdfunding as entertainment, and then presents a new project in development at Georgia Tech as a part of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing that tries to apply some of these lessons from popular personal electronics projects, including Kickstarted products like Twine, and related projects like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

title: Lahu Girls' Expectations: An Anthropological Documentation Film
description: This is a documentary film about a five-year anthropological case study of Lahu girls from a minority community in southwestern China. It records the school life of 45 Lahu girls who came from the Lahu community along the Lancang/Mekong River bordering the Sino-Burmese border. Taking advantage of a school education, these girls tried to enter a 21st century globalized industrial society from a matriarchic society. Would they succeed? How should state school education handle the relationship between the state's agenda and ethnic nationalism in a multilingual society? Dr. Teng examines these issues in the 45-minute documentary which will be followed by a discussion.

title: CAM Presents: Essential Oils and Healing- Aromatherapy Workshop
description: Complementary and Alternative Medicine at UMD Presents an Aromatherapy Workshop with Aromatherapy Practitioner Patricia Bonnard. Learn the art of using essential oils. The focus is on subtle aromatherapy and scent, and how they affect the emotions using the stress as an example. Unlike our other senses that are perceived by the left brain/frontal cortex, aromas and our sense of smell is perceived by our right brain/limbic brain, which is the seat of our emotions, memories and the regulation of key bodily functions like sleep, hunger, thirst, body temperature and sex drive. It is also the source of our "fight or flight" danger and stress response. All are welcome at this free public event. Light refreshments will be provided after the workshop.

title: CAM Presents: Essential Oils and Healing- Aromatherapy Workshop
description: Complementary and Alternative Medicine at UMD Presents an Aromatherapy Workshop with Aromatherapy Practitioner Patricia Bonnard. Learn the art of using essential oils. The focus is on subtle aromatherapy and scent, and how they affect the emotions using the stress as an example. Unlike our other senses that are perceived by the left brain/frontal cortex, aromas and our sense of smell is perceived by our right brain/limbic brain, which is the seat of our emotions, memories and the regulation of key bodily functions like sleep, hunger, thirst, body temperature and sex drive. It is also the source of our "fight or flight" danger and stress response. All are welcome at this free public event. Light refreshments will be provided after the workshop.
