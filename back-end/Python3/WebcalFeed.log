We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.

We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.

We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.

summary: This should be relevant for any students (from first years to graduating seniors) who are interested in knowing more about (a) what grad school is all about and (b) how to succeed in the application process. We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.

summary: This should be relevant for any students (from first years to graduating seniors) who are interested in knowing more about (a) what grad school is all about and (b) how to succeed in the application process. We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.

summary: This should be relevant for any students (from first years to graduating seniors) who are interested in knowing more about (a) what grad school is all about and (b) how to succeed in the application process. We'll have current faculty and current grad students talk about both of these, as well as a FAQ session. For those who are currently applying, they're encouraged to bring specific questions about their applications. For those who are a year or more away from applying, they're encouraged to bring their curiosity about what grad school is all about . There will be pizza.
